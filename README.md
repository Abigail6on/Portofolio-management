# Calculate expected return

Linear algebra is pervasive in finance and in general. For example, the calculation of optimal weights according to modern portfolio theory is done using linear algebra techniques. The arrays and functions in NumPy allow us to handle these calculations in an intuitive way. For a quick intro to linear algebra and how to use NumPy to do more significant matrix calculations, proceed to the next section.

# Matrix multiplication

With matrix multiplication, the order in which the matrices are multiplied matters. Multiplying a matrix on the left side by another matrix may be just fine, but multiplying on the right may be undefined.

# Portfolio Variance
First, we calculate the covariance matrix that relates all the individual stocks in our universe.

For a reference on the evaluation of the variance of a portfolio as a matrix equation, please see the Wikipedia article on modern portfolio theory.
